## Latest Fixes (Feb 2026 — iterations 26-43)

### Iter 43: Compound Invite Links — Self-Registration ✅
- **🔗 Shareable invite links per compound**: Admins generate tokens that residents/managers/security can use to self-register without manual onboarding.
- **Backend** (`routes/compound_invites.py` — 7 endpoints):
  - `POST /api/compound-invites` (with role/validity_days/max_uses/note) — 3 roles can create: app_owner, super_admin, company_admin (of parent company)
  - `GET /api/compound-invites?compound_id=X` — list + effective_status (active/expired/used_up/revoked)
  - `DELETE /api/compound-invites/{id}` — revoke
  - **Public endpoints** (no auth): `GET /compound-invites/token/{token}` and `POST /compound-invites/token/{token}/accept` — the latter creates the user account with `source: "invite_link"` + `invite_id` audit fields, atomically increments `used_count`, validates expiry/max_uses/revocation.
- **Frontend**:
  - `InviteLinkModal` (`components/shared/InviteLinkModal.js`): reusable modal with create form + existing invites list + 📋 copy + 📱 WhatsApp share + 🚫 revoke.
  - `JoinViaInvite` (`pages/JoinViaInvite.js`): public route `/join/:token` — validates token, shows compound info (name, location, parent company, role), renders registration form.
  - **Integrated** into both `CompanyAdminDashboard` (🔗 دعوة button on each compound card) and `CompaniesTab` (🔗 button in the action bar of each nested compound).
- **Security**: ownership check on every create/revoke (company_admin can only create for compounds under their company). Public accept is rate-bounded by `max_uses` and TTL.
- **Tested end-to-end**: 6-step curl roundtrip (create → public view → accept → list (used_count=1) → revoke → revoked token returns 410) all pass. Playwright screenshots confirm modal and public page render correctly in Arabic.

### Iter 42: Owner Nav Fix + Company Admin Dashboard ✅
- **🔗 Fixed Owner Quick Nav**: "شركات الإدارة" button now links to `/app/super-admin?tab=companies` (the full CRUD hierarchical CompaniesTab) instead of the narrow subscriptions page.
- **🏢 New `CompanyAdminDashboard`** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/CompanyAdminDashboard.js`): Dedicated dashboard for `company_admin` role users. On login, they see:
  - Their company header (name, code, email, phone) with stats (compounds count, total users, activity count)
  - Grid of all compounds under their company with per-compound stats (residents/managers/security/total)
  - **➕ Add Compound**, **✏️ Edit**, **🗑 Delete**, **➕ Add User** actions (scoped strictly to their own company)
  - Graceful error screen if account isn't linked to a company
- **🆕 Backend routes** (`/app/backend/routes/company_admin.py`): 7 endpoints scoped by `company_id` derived from logged-in user — ownership checks on every operation to prevent cross-company access.
  - `GET /api/company-admin/me` • `GET /api/company-admin/compounds`
  - `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/company-admin/compounds/{id}`
  - `GET/POST /api/company-admin/compounds/{id}/users`
- **🔗 Data migration**: Linked 3 existing `company_admin` users (testcompany2, testco3, companytest5) to companies for testing. Reset `testcompany2` password to `Company123!`.
- **Routing**: `DashboardRouter` now sends `company_admin` → `CompanyAdminDashboard` (previously got generic AdminDashboard).
- **Tested end-to-end**: curl + Playwright screenshot show the full Arabic dashboard with "شركة المعمار الحديث" loaded, 1 compound (رويال سيتي), 8 users, full CRUD buttons rendering correctly.

### Iter 41: Deployment Readiness Health Check — PASS ✅
- **Deployment verdict: READY FOR PRODUCTION** (deployment agent returned `status: pass`, zero findings)
- Fixed **130 unbounded MongoDB queries** across all backend routes — bulk sed replacement of `.to_list(None)` / `.to_list(length=None)` → `.to_list(length=10000)` to prevent unbounded memory load in production. Safer than unbounded, non-breaking for any practical data volume.
- Verified all major endpoints post-fix: `/api/health`, `/docs`, hierarchical-subs, companies, dashboard, management-contracts, advertiser-ads all return 200 with full payload.
- All other checks: ✅ env vars only, ✅ CORS production-ready, ✅ JWT auth, ✅ supervisor config, ✅ no hardcoded secrets/URLs, ✅ no ML/blockchain deps, ✅ MongoDB via env vars.

### Iter 40: Grid View + Super Admin Ads Confirmed + Refactoring ✅
- **▦ Grid view for compounds**: Toggle between nested (by company) and grid (all compounds flat). Grid has 4 filters (search, parent company dropdown, min users count, subscription status) + live summary counters + 5 action buttons per card (add-user/contract/edit/export/delete).
- **🎯 Super Admin ads verified**: `require_super_admin` allows both `super_admin` and `app_owner` roles → super admin can create/edit/delete ads via `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/ads`. UI shows the "إنشاء إعلان جديد" button for both roles (no `isSuperAdminOnly` guard). Verified via curl with superadmin credentials.
- **🔧 Refactoring** (minimal-risk surgical):
  - Frontend: extracted `ContractModal` (→ `companies/ContractModal.js`) and `CompoundsGridView` (→ `companies/CompoundsGridView.js`) from CompaniesTab.js. File shrunk from **1236 → 920 lines** (-25%).
  - Backend: extracted compound admin endpoints (PUT/DELETE/GET-export) to `routes/compound_admin.py` (104 lines). `superadmin.py` shrunk from 1833 → 1745 lines.
  - All endpoints verified post-refactor (curl roundtrip: create→update→export→delete → 200 each).

### Iter 39: Full Compound CRUD inside Companies Management Tab ✅
- **🎯 Unified compound management**: All compound admin (add/edit/delete/export) now happens from within the `إدارة الشركات` (Companies) tab, consolidating what used to be spread between the Residential-Compounds overview and the Companies tab.
- **Backend endpoints** added to `superadmin.py`:
  - `PUT /api/super-admin/compounds/{id}` — update compound (name/location/address/description) + **move to another parent company** (updates `companies.compound_ids` arrays on both sides).
  - `DELETE /api/super-admin/compounds/{id}?force=true|false` — safety guard: blocks delete when compound has users unless `force=true`, which also unlinks users (doesn't delete them). Cascades to management_contracts deletion.
  - `GET /api/super-admin/compounds/{id}/export` — downloadable JSON bundle (compound + parent_company + users + subscriptions + management_contracts + aggregate stats).
- **Frontend — CompaniesTab.js**: Each compound row (inside an expanded company) now shows 5 action buttons: ➕ إضافة ساكن (green) • 📋 العقد (amber) • ✏️ تعديل (blue, opens EditCompoundModal with parent-company dropdown for relocation) • 📑 تصدير (indigo, downloads JSON) • 🗑 حذف (red, smart confirm when users exist).
- **Test results**: backend curl roundtrip verified (create→update→export→delete 200; delete-with-users 400; delete with `force=true` 200 + unlinked_users count). UI screenshot confirms all 5 buttons render correctly.

### Iter 38: Management Contracts + Bulk Users + Advertiser Self-Service Portal ✅
- **📋 Management Contracts (Company ↔ Compound)** — comprehensive model with start/end dates, commission %, fixed fee, billing cycle (monthly/yearly/per_unit/one_time), currency, auto-renewal (calendar-accurate via `relativedelta`), 30-day expiry warning, PDF attachment (up to 5MB, base64 data URL). Backend: `POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/super-admin/management-contracts`, `GET /…/pdf` (download), `POST /…/process-auto-renew`. Frontend: amber `📋 العقد` button on every compound → ContractModal with view / create / edit modes and file upload.
- **📦 Bulk Users** — `POST /api/super-admin/users/bulk` with batch-scope duplicate detection, per-row error reports. Frontend: `AddUserModal` has two tabs (Single / Bulk) with CSV file picker + paste textarea + parse/preview table (20-row preview) + success/failure report.
- **📢 Advertiser Self-Service Portal (Lite)** — public `/advertiser-register` page, protected `/app/advertiser` dashboard (stats + ads list + create modal with live EGP pricing). Backend: `POST /api/advertiser/register`, full ads CRUD under `/api/advertiser/ads`, mock Stripe payment (returns mock=true when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is unset), impression/click tracking public endpoints. Super Admin side: new tab `إعلانات المعلنين` (AdvertiserAdsTab) with filter pills, approve/reject workflow, approved ads auto-pushed to `internal_ads` collection for in-app display.
- **Test results (iteration_37.json)**: backend 29/29 pytest PASSED on first run; frontend 100% of UI paths reached; no critical issues; minor review comments noted for future (tighten advertiser role guard, pdf bandwidth optim, split CompaniesTab into sub-files).

### Iter 37: Inline Add Compound + Add Resident buttons ✅
- **➕ Add Compound button** inside each company's expanded view (purple) — opens modal with name/location/address/description; uses existing `POST /super-admin/companies/{company_id}/compounds`.
- **➕ Add Resident/User button** on every compound card (green) — opens modal with full_name/username/email/password/phone/unit + role picker (resident/family_head/manager/security/admin); uses existing `POST /super-admin/users` with compound_id auto-injected.
- Backend verified via curl (compound create + user create roundtrip, both return 200 with expected payload).
- UI verified via Playwright screenshot — both buttons render correctly inside CompaniesTab after expanding a company.

### Iter 36: Companies Tab — Import JSON + Top 10 + Removed Link UI ✅
- **🏆 Top 10 Companies dashboard** (new endpoint `GET /super-admin/companies/top10?metric=compounds|users|revenue|active_subs`): ranked table with 🥇🥈🥉 medals, metric toggle buttons, highlight column for selected metric, summary footer
- **📥 JSON Import** (new endpoint `POST /super-admin/import-full-structure` with multipart upload + `mode=merge|replace`): restores Companies + Compounds from a previous export. Merge is safe (adds new + updates existing); Replace wipes current companies+compounds first. Upload modal with radio-button mode selector and file size display.
- **🔗 Linking UI removed from Owner panel**: per user direction ("each company adds its own compounds"), removed 🔗 link button, Link modal, and ❌ unlink button from CompaniesTab. Backend link/unlink endpoints kept for future per-company-admin use.
- **Info message updated** when a company has no compounds: explains the company adds its own from its dedicated panel.
- **Test results**: export→import roundtrip verified (5 updated companies + 2 updated compounds); Top 10 ranking accurate across 4 metrics; UI smoke test confirms all 4 action-bar buttons render and modals open correctly.
