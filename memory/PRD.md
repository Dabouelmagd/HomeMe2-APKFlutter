## Latest Fixes (Feb 2026 — iterations 26-40)

### Iter 40: Grid View + Super Admin Ads Confirmed + Refactoring ✅
- **▦ Grid view for compounds**: Toggle between nested (by company) and grid (all compounds flat). Grid has 4 filters (search, parent company dropdown, min users count, subscription status) + live summary counters + 5 action buttons per card (add-user/contract/edit/export/delete).
- **🎯 Super Admin ads verified**: `require_super_admin` allows both `super_admin` and `app_owner` roles → super admin can create/edit/delete ads via `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/ads`. UI shows the "إنشاء إعلان جديد" button for both roles (no `isSuperAdminOnly` guard). Verified via curl with superadmin credentials.
- **🔧 Refactoring** (minimal-risk surgical):
  - Frontend: extracted `ContractModal` (→ `companies/ContractModal.js`) and `CompoundsGridView` (→ `companies/CompoundsGridView.js`) from CompaniesTab.js. File shrunk from **1236 → 920 lines** (-25%).
  - Backend: extracted compound admin endpoints (PUT/DELETE/GET-export) to `routes/compound_admin.py` (104 lines). `superadmin.py` shrunk from 1833 → 1745 lines.
  - All endpoints verified post-refactor (curl roundtrip: create→update→export→delete → 200 each).

### Iter 39: Full Compound CRUD inside Companies Management Tab ✅
- **🎯 Unified compound management**: All compound admin (add/edit/delete/export) now happens from within the `إدارة الشركات` (Companies) tab, consolidating what used to be spread between the Residential-Compounds overview and the Companies tab.
- **Backend endpoints** added to `superadmin.py`:
  - `PUT /api/super-admin/compounds/{id}` — update compound (name/location/address/description) + **move to another parent company** (updates `companies.compound_ids` arrays on both sides).
  - `DELETE /api/super-admin/compounds/{id}?force=true|false` — safety guard: blocks delete when compound has users unless `force=true`, which also unlinks users (doesn't delete them). Cascades to management_contracts deletion.
  - `GET /api/super-admin/compounds/{id}/export` — downloadable JSON bundle (compound + parent_company + users + subscriptions + management_contracts + aggregate stats).
- **Frontend — CompaniesTab.js**: Each compound row (inside an expanded company) now shows 5 action buttons: ➕ إضافة ساكن (green) • 📋 العقد (amber) • ✏️ تعديل (blue, opens EditCompoundModal with parent-company dropdown for relocation) • 📑 تصدير (indigo, downloads JSON) • 🗑 حذف (red, smart confirm when users exist).
- **Test results**: backend curl roundtrip verified (create→update→export→delete 200; delete-with-users 400; delete with `force=true` 200 + unlinked_users count). UI screenshot confirms all 5 buttons render correctly.

### Iter 38: Management Contracts + Bulk Users + Advertiser Self-Service Portal ✅
- **📋 Management Contracts (Company ↔ Compound)** — comprehensive model with start/end dates, commission %, fixed fee, billing cycle (monthly/yearly/per_unit/one_time), currency, auto-renewal (calendar-accurate via `relativedelta`), 30-day expiry warning, PDF attachment (up to 5MB, base64 data URL). Backend: `POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/super-admin/management-contracts`, `GET /…/pdf` (download), `POST /…/process-auto-renew`. Frontend: amber `📋 العقد` button on every compound → ContractModal with view / create / edit modes and file upload.
- **📦 Bulk Users** — `POST /api/super-admin/users/bulk` with batch-scope duplicate detection, per-row error reports. Frontend: `AddUserModal` has two tabs (Single / Bulk) with CSV file picker + paste textarea + parse/preview table (20-row preview) + success/failure report.
- **📢 Advertiser Self-Service Portal (Lite)** — public `/advertiser-register` page, protected `/app/advertiser` dashboard (stats + ads list + create modal with live EGP pricing). Backend: `POST /api/advertiser/register`, full ads CRUD under `/api/advertiser/ads`, mock Stripe payment (returns mock=true when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is unset), impression/click tracking public endpoints. Super Admin side: new tab `إعلانات المعلنين` (AdvertiserAdsTab) with filter pills, approve/reject workflow, approved ads auto-pushed to `internal_ads` collection for in-app display.
- **Test results (iteration_37.json)**: backend 29/29 pytest PASSED on first run; frontend 100% of UI paths reached; no critical issues; minor review comments noted for future (tighten advertiser role guard, pdf bandwidth optim, split CompaniesTab into sub-files).

### Iter 37: Inline Add Compound + Add Resident buttons ✅
- **➕ Add Compound button** inside each company's expanded view (purple) — opens modal with name/location/address/description; uses existing `POST /super-admin/companies/{company_id}/compounds`.
- **➕ Add Resident/User button** on every compound card (green) — opens modal with full_name/username/email/password/phone/unit + role picker (resident/family_head/manager/security/admin); uses existing `POST /super-admin/users` with compound_id auto-injected.
- Backend verified via curl (compound create + user create roundtrip, both return 200 with expected payload).
- UI verified via Playwright screenshot — both buttons render correctly inside CompaniesTab after expanding a company.

### Iter 36: Companies Tab — Import JSON + Top 10 + Removed Link UI ✅
- **🏆 Top 10 Companies dashboard** (new endpoint `GET /super-admin/companies/top10?metric=compounds|users|revenue|active_subs`): ranked table with 🥇🥈🥉 medals, metric toggle buttons, highlight column for selected metric, summary footer
- **📥 JSON Import** (new endpoint `POST /super-admin/import-full-structure` with multipart upload + `mode=merge|replace`): restores Companies + Compounds from a previous export. Merge is safe (adds new + updates existing); Replace wipes current companies+compounds first. Upload modal with radio-button mode selector and file size display.
- **🔗 Linking UI removed from Owner panel**: per user direction ("each company adds its own compounds"), removed 🔗 link button, Link modal, and ❌ unlink button from CompaniesTab. Backend link/unlink endpoints kept for future per-company-admin use.
- **Info message updated** when a company has no compounds: explains the company adds its own from its dedicated panel.
- **Test results**: export→import roundtrip verified (5 updated companies + 2 updated compounds); Top 10 ranking accurate across 4 metrics; UI smoke test confirms all 4 action-bar buttons render and modals open correctly.

## Architecture
- Frontend: React + Tailwind + Shadcn + recharts + sub-components in `/components/super-admin/` (AdsTab, UsersTab, CodesTab, CouponsTab, CompoundDetailModal, HierarchicalSubs, CompaniesTab with embedded Top10/Import modals)
- Backend: FastAPI + reportlab (PDF) + modular routes in `/backend/routes/`
- DB: MongoDB. Collections: users, compounds, **companies** (authoritative), user_subscriptions, company_subscriptions, user_gifts, bulk_campaigns, auto_renewal_config, coupons, internal_ads, security_incidents, complaints, families, budgets, services, notifications
- Email: shared `email_service` (SMTP via .env)
- Push: pywebpush + VAPID (web only)

## Backlog
- P2: Bank transfer API (blocked on user credentials)
- P2: Smart Devices & Automation (deferred) — still **MOCKED**
- P3: Advertiser Self-Service Portal (multi-sprint feature)
- Nice-to-have: Management Contract model (user deferred)
- Nice-to-have: AI-suggest for auto-linking compounds (user deferred)
- Nice-to-have: Email invitation to company admin upon creation (user deferred)

## Health
- Broken: none
- MOCKED: Smart Devices module
- Auto-renewal: `enabled:false` (safe default)
- Test users: see `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`
